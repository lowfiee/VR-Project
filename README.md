# ***VR Project***
## Virtual Store 

_Created by Conner Marks, Jacob Mahe, Sasha Koroleva, Farzana Tanni_

For our VR project, we decided to do a simple store that is supposed to be used for large shopping retail companies (Ex. Amazon, Walmart etc). This project is meant for those who are unable to go out and shop; due to disabilities or mental issues (social anxiety, trauma). 

### How to use:

This game follows simple VR interactions
- To grip: use the grip buttons on either controller
- To walk: use the **left** joystick
- To turn without turning your body, use the **right** joystick

Issues and errors:
- Minor issue: Some choppiness when turning using the **right** joystick may happen.
