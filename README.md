# ***VR Project - Group 6***
## Virtual Store 

_Created by Conner Marks, Jacob Mahe, Sasha Koroleva, Farzana Tanni_

For our VR project, we decided to do a simple store that is supposed to be used for large shopping retail companies (Ex. Amazon, Walmart etc). 
This project is meant for those who are unable to go out and shop; due to disabilities or mental issues (social anxiety, trauma). 

### How to use:

This game follows simple VR interactions:
- To grip: use the grip buttons on either controller
- To walk: use the **left** joystick
- To turn without turning your body, use the **right** joystick
- To leave experience, press the Oculus "O" symbol and quit

How to play:
1) Grab an object (Shark or calculator)
2) Add items to basket if you'd like
3) Swipe the item in the scanner on the right side of the self-checkout

### Note:
No visual aids were made as it uses very basic VR movements, but could have been made for picking up which
specific objects (Shark and calculator) and for scanning

Issues and errors:
- Minor issue: Some choppiness when picking up an object
